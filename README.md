## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Animation
- Desktop-first workflow
- Node.js and Express JS for making a server to run the app on the backend.

### What I learned

I learned to make a good layout using plain CSS, flexbox and grids. Also implemented node.js application, where via express library set up the server.
Responsiveness: there was no need for adding more code @media queries to make the project mobile friendly. Because existing design itself mobile friendly.
Also implemented native CSS nesting property, eliminating the need to use third-party libraries.

### Continued development

I would introduce QR generation logic here, for example, app creates on the server QR-code for website or any other link, and generates the picture and send to the client the png QR-code together with CSS.

### Useful resources

At that time I mainly used Google Gemini AI generator. It helped with complex complexes. However, Page Styling and Semantics are done by me.
